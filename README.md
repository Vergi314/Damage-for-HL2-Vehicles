A simple script that adds health to vehicles and the ability to damage them, i am surprised how no one has ever made this before.
This adds combat damage (bullets/hits) as well as physical collision damage (e.g crashing your car, hitting it, falling with it) to vehicles as well as detailed gibbing and explosion effects, while staying faithful to the vanilla style AND looking cool!

# FEATURES:

- Adjustable health / damage system for the jeep, airboat and even the jalopy from Half-Life 2: Episode 2! (As well as vehicles that use jeep base and airboat base)
- Many convars for all possible parameters, as well as an options menu, find it in "Utilities" tab, under "Vergi's Addons" section.
- Visualizer for damage (the vehicles will become gradually more scorched / darker as they take damage, there is also a convar to disable it although i do not recommend it cause you can't tell the amount of health left for the car at all otherwise).
- Cool effects! Vehicles will create a spark and catch on fire once it is extremely damaged, giving you a few moments for you to get back, as it will explode and leave a fire behind, and shoot up a bunch of giblets!
- Detailed vehicle gibbing that uses gibs from the vehicle models themselves with some randomized additional gibs shared across all vehicle types. Vehicles that use jeep or airboat base but don't have a model matching to the vanilla HL2 vehicles will use generic gibs instead, in order to appear more believable and not look strange.
- Adjustable chance of loot items such as ammo boxes and suit batteries being expelled from the vehicles when exploding.
- Minimalist gore! When a player dies inside of an exploding vehicle, a blood splat will be left at the explosion site, and skeletal remains such as skulls and spines will be sent flying everywhere! (this can also be disabled via convar/options)
- Optimization (only 18mb filesize, and checks were added in the code in order to make the action run only when the requirements are met, additionally, the vehicle gibs have no collision and despawn after 10 seconds by default)
- Physical collision system has finally been added to this version of the mod, allowing you to crash and bump your car and actually damage it in the process! There are convars/options for adjusting the collision system's sensitivity (0.3 by default, as that is the sweetspot) or even disabling it completely.
- Vehicle handling is now slightly worsened gradually as vehicle health gets lowered.
